# Cursor Communication Rules

## Message Formatting
- AI Assistant (Claude) must start each message with ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–
- User messages should be prepended with ðŸ‘¤ðŸ‘¤ðŸ‘¤
- These emojis help visually distinguish between different speakers in the conversation

## JavaScript to TypeScript Strategy
- Phase 1: Pure JavaScript
  - Focus on React components
  - Component composition

- Phase 2: JSDoc Integration
  - Add type hints via comments
  - Learn type concepts gradually
  - Document component props
  - Type-safe function signatures

- Phase 3: TypeScript Migration
  - Convert .js to .tsx
  - Add type definitions
  - Implement interfaces
  - Type-safe state management

## CLI Command Handling
- Always use the main UI terminal for CLI commands
- Clearly explain the purpose of each command before executing
- For commands requiring user input:
  - Explain what input is needed
  - Wait for explicit user confirmation
  - Do not proceed until user provides the required input
- For long-running commands:
  - Specify if they should run in background
  - Provide clear instructions for stopping the command
- Always verify command success before proceeding
- If a command fails, explain the error and suggest solutions

## Version Control
- Use meaningful commit messages following conventional commits format
- Create feature branches for new functionality
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Reference issue numbers in commits when applicable
- Review changes before committing
- Push changes regularly to maintain backup

## Code Changes
- Always explain changes before making them
- Use the edit_file tool for code modifications
- Include clear commit messages for changes

## Learning Context
- Tailor explanations to the user's current knowledge level

## Communication Style
- Be concise and clear
- Use bullet points for multiple items
- Provide examples when explaining complex concepts
- Ask for clarification when needed
